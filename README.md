# ðŸšš Food Delivery Time Prediction

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The objective is to predict whether a food delivery will be **"Fast"** or **"Delayed"** using machine learning models. This is a **binary classification problem** based on features like:
- Customer location
- Restaurant location
- Weather conditions
- Traffic status
- Distance
- Vehicle type

## ðŸ“Š Phase 1: Data Preprocessing

### ðŸ”¹ Data Import and Cleaning
- Load dataset: `Food_Delivery_Time_Prediction.csv`
- Handle missing values using **mean/median imputation**
- Encode categorical features (weather, traffic, vehicle type) using **LabelEncoder**
- Normalize continuous features like `Distance` and `Delivery Time` using `StandardScaler`

### ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering
- Compute **geographical distance** using latitude and longitude (Haversine formula)
- Convert delivery time into binary class:
  - **1 = Delayed**, **0 = Fast** (threshold based on average or median delivery time)

## ðŸ§  Phase 2: Classification Models

### âœ… 1. Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Model Used**: Gaussian Naive Bayes (suitable for continuous features)
- **Target**: `Delivery_Status` (Fast = 0, Delayed = 1)
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

### âœ… 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Model**: KNN Classifier with `n_neighbors = K`
- **Tuning**:
  - Use GridSearchCV or cross-validation to find optimal `K`
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

### âœ… 3. Decision Tree Classifier
- **Model**: Decision Tree Classifier (`sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`)
- **Tuning**:
  - `max_depth` to limit tree depth
  - `min_samples_split` to control split threshold
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
This project builds a robust **binary classification pipeline** using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and three classification algorithms â€” Naive Bayes, KNN, and Decision Tree. It aims to support **delivery optimization** and **customer satisfaction** through data-driven decision making.

ðŸ“¦ **Future Enhancements**: Model deployment via Flask API, dashboard visualization, or integration with food delivery platforms.
